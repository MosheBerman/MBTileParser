MBTileParser
=============

*Look Ma, a game engine! Running on UIKit!* MBTileParser is a small game engine that supports loading TMX files and TexturePacker files directly into UIKit.


Screenshots & Demo:
---
I've uploaded [a demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o88YOnmzj44) to YouTube.

Here's what the game engine looks like in action:

Features:

MBTileParser can do five things right now. Load maps, load sprites, display dialog, take input via virtual controls, and retain game state.

 - **Load maps:** MBTileParser is actually the name of a class in the engine. You can load TMX files. Use the `MBMapViewController` class for this.
 - **Load sprites:** You can load sprites using `MBSpriteView`. `MBMovableSpriteView` supports movement too.
 - **Display Dialog:** Load and parse dialog trees, using `MBDialogTree`. (Support for end actions is now implemented.)
 - **Take Input:** Create custom virtual game controls, using the `MBJoystick` and `MBControllerButton` classes. You can also use the included layout.
 - **Manage Games State:** The latest update includes state support (in progress) which allows you to track levels, stamina, score, items, dialog, and more.
 
Setting it Up:
---

Clone into, or download, the repository. Copy the folder called `MBGameEngine` and import `MBGameEngine.h`.

You can also use cocoapods: 

	pod 'MBTileParser'

Technical Requirements:
---

MBTileParser requires the iOS 6 SDK and ARC.

To support versions of iOS prior to version 6, you'll need to  replace `NSUUID`, used in the `MBGameState` class.

If you're stuck on Xcode 4.4, you can [hack subscripting support](http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2012/using-subscripting-with-Xcode-4_4-and-iOS-4_3) into Xcode, but I'm not supporting this. Seriously, upgrade Xcode to the latest version.

Even if your project doesn't use ARC, you'll want to compile MBTileParser with ARC. Use the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag for that.

 
Notes:

**About the TMX format, Tiled, and TexturePacker:** The TMX file format is used by Tiled, a tool which helps you make world maps for games by tiling images. (You can download Tiled [here](http://mapeditor.org)). The TMX format is explained in detail on the [tiled GitHub repository wiki](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format). The developer of TexturePacker, Andreas LÃ¶w, was kind enough to give me a license a while back. Thanks Andreas! You can [get TexturePacker from his website](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker).

**Parting Words:** Please take a moment to star this repository and pass it along to anyone who you think might enjoy it. I also encourage you to look at my other repositories. You might find something you like.

Always have fun, because game engines are fun.
